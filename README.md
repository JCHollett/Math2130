Projects for the Technical Writing Math Course I have taken with Doctor Ivan Booth who is an amazing and inspiring math professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland.
I wrote these projects in C# because it was a language I intended to learn better instead of staying in my comfort zone. 

Project 1: Quadratic Formula Project. This project has no source code, however, I include it for completeness.

Project 2: The Kepler Oerth Project. The goal of this project was to research the various mechanics of orbital physics using projectile motion.
The formulas used are derived from Kepler's and Newton's laws for observing objects in a fixed system around an origin.
Unlike projectile motion in physics courses, this uses a delta time step to calculate the trajectory. As the Projectile moves, the acceleration of gravity changes pointing to the origin.

Project 3: The Ancestry Project. The goal of this project was to prove how soon common ancestry can be expected by using Randomized testing within generations of species.
This uses the concept of recursion and linked trees. Doctor Booth's ideas were critical to making my code more efficient. I learned a lot about organizing code from his suggestions.

Project 4: The Traffic Simulation Project. The goal of this project was to examine how traffic jams occur and dissipate in a closed loop system. Using a circular linked list representing an array this project's goal is to prove how jams occur and how they equalize an spread.
Using several techniques such as overlay a bell curve distribution of random slowdowns, I was able to improve my testing and research using ideas presented by Doctor Booth.
